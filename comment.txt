Today, the class wrote the Unit 4 test on factoring algebraic expressions. The average score on this test was 72%, which I found encouraging, given that this is typically a challenging unit for many students. 

For students who struggle with the material, it is surprising what a mere 20–30 minutes of extra help can do to make the confusing suddenly comprehensible. I so often hear, “Ah, I get it now!” during these sessions. I am available at lunchtime and after school any day except Thursday. 

There are still a number of students showing up to class each day without their own calculators. The overall class average is sitting at a comfortable 70%. 

Now, onto Unit 5: Quadratics (that’s parabolas, for those of you who are triggered by your own memories of high school math). Cue evil cackle.
